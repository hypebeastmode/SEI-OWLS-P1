# SEI-OWLS-P1
Project 1 for SEI-OWLS



# Super

Our assignment for Project 1 was to clone an existing website and add some of our own designs and features to showcase what we've learned so far in the SEI course and to explore the possibilites in the design aspect for the front end. The website I decided to clone was Uber. Uber is well known for their taxi services so I decided to call my site "Super" which is an airline company.

## Getting Started

To get started the user clicks on the deployment link which will bring them to Super's landing page. They'll then be greeted with a CSS animation that says "Come Fly With Super".

On the header of the page the user will see the company name and the nav bar. For this assignment the login is the only item that when the user clicks on will activate a login box to appear in the center of the screen.

The main content section shows all the different types of services that Super offers to its customers. For this assignment I created the Careers and Planes sections to have a click feature that shows more information about these services.

The footer section was a great opportunity to use flexbox and showcase its powerful abilities. Using a combination of flexbox rows and columns made the site look professional.
